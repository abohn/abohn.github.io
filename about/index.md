My name is Andy Bohn, and I am a Ph.D. Candidate at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu) in the
[physics department](http://www.physics.cornell.edu).

I currently work in the field of numerical relativity, where I use
supercomputers to study the interactions between black holes, neutron stars,
gravitational waves, and anything else Einstein's theory of relativity
predicts.
Head over to my [research page](/research) for more information.
Before coming to *sunny* Ithaca, New York in 2010, I attended
[Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu), where I received
degrees in physics and mathematics.
