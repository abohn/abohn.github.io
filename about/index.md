My name is Andy Bohn, and I am a Ph.D. Candidate at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu) in the
[physics department](http://www.physics.cornell.edu).

I currently work in the field of numerical relativity, where I use
supercomputers to study the interactions between black holes, neutron stars,
gravitational waves, and anything else Einstein's theory of relativity
predicts.
Head over to my [research page](/research) for more information.
Before coming to *sunny* Ithaca, New York in 2010, I attended
[Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu), where I received
degrees in physics and mathematics.

## Hobbies

I like to program random things in my free time.
You can see a few examples in my blog posts.
I enjoy engaging in random sports or physical activities as often as my work
allows.
I currently bike, run, play soccer, and go to the gym (when I can wake up
early enough).

I love music (who doesn't), especially
[drum corps](http://www.dci.org).
I play the piano and almost any percussion
instrument you can name.
Here's a couple pictures of my rudimental snare
drumming days in high school:

(I'm in the middle of the snare line with the blue cap)

I should probably find some better pictures, or maybe
post some videos!
I played snare in the marching band and winter drumline
all 4 years of high school,
and was accepted into the
2005 BOA Honor Band for the Rose Bowl parade.

(see 1:10, 1:28, 1:38, for extremely jpeggy examples).

I've recently been getting into chess, but I watch
much more chess than I play.
I have a few neat blog posts coming up about
chess and programming, so stay tuned!

*more to come, if I find more hobbies or time to expand this page*
