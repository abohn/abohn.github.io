In the mean time, I'll leave some content I'm proud of.

### Accretion disk

Our group has checked the *Interstellar* accretion disk imagery by
comparing against one of our own accretion disk images around a maximally
spinning black hole.

I will include more information about this soon.

### Binary black holes

Here are some videos that we've uploaded to youtube showing two different
viewpoints of the same binary black hole merger.
The mass ratio is 3 to 1, the large hole has a dimensionless spin of 0.7,
and the small hole has a dimensionless spin of 0.3 in arbitrary initial
configurations.

Details about the code and this simulation can be found in
[our paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/32/6/065002/meta;jsessionid=0E14FD34AE7447123AA089406922C8A2.c1) in
Classical and Quantum Gravity.

We have widescreen versions of these videos, which I will upload asap.
