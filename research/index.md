### Getting started

When I was in grade school and first learned that mysterious objects called
black holes existed, a few
questions that instantly popped into my head were:

1. What does a black hole really look like?
2. What would happen if you fell into a black hole?
3. What happens when one black hole tries to eat another black hole?

At the time, I didn't know how to find serious
answers to these questions,
and they unfortunately lay dormant in the back of my mind for another decade
or so.

Fast forward to my first summer of graduate school at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) in 2011, when the budding students
were supposed to try and find a research group to start a fruitful research
career with many research papers (or something like that).
My friend Francois told me he wanted to study black holes and neutron stars
with
[Saul Teukolsky](http://astro.cornell.edu/members/saul-a-teukolsky.html).
In an instant all of my questions about black holes came flooding back to the
forefront of my mind, and I was fortunate enough to start to pursue
questions about black holes with Saul straight away!

### What my group studies

I do work in the
[Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration](http://www.black-holes.org/)
studying merging black holes and neutron stars.
Here's a little bit of backstory:

Einstein's theory of
[General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)
makes a whole host of predictions that can be experimentally verified.
One important example is that
[light is bent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#Light_deflection_and_gravitational_time_delay)
in a particular way by gravity,
so light rays passing by the sun are slightly bent around the sun.

Another example is [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), which could not
properly operate without relativity.
GPS operates by satellites in orbit
sending messages that say what time the message was
sent as well as which satellite sent the message.
A GPS device receives these messages, computes how far away each satellite was, then
[triangulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation) its location.
For a GPS device to be accurate to about 15 meters, the GPS satellites must be
accurate to about 50 nanoseconds (50 nanoseconds = 15 meters / speed of light).
An interesting consequence of general relativity is that time ticks more slowly
when in a stronger field of gravity than otherwise.
GPS satellites orbit 12,600 miles above the surface of the Earth and experience a
four times weaker field of gravity than on the surface, so the satellite clock
is about 45 microseconds faster per day than a clock on Earth.
Without General Relativity (and Special Relativity for similar timing reasons),
GPS would have significant issues to deal with.

As technology and ingenuity advances, we have been able to test more and
more of the theory with increasing accuracy, and the theory has passed with flying
colors.
General relativity also predicts the existence of
a type of gravitational radiation called gravitational waves.

Einstein's general relativity describes gravity
as an intrinsic property of space and time.
Sources of gravity cause space and time to become
curved, and all objects in the universe simply try to move in straight lines
in this curved space-time.
The moon orbiting the Earth is following a straight
line in the curved space-time near the Earth, which
causes it to orbit.
Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of
space-time.

Directly detecting gravitational radiation would
be a large step in cementing the theory of general
relativity.
However, being unable to detect gravitational radiation, or detecting
radiation that we didn't expect would start an incredible journey
in discovering entirely new physics!

One of the primary goals of my research group is to aid in the detection
of gravitational radiation.
I'll explain this more in a page about
[detecting gravitational waves]({{site.url}}/research/gravitational-waves.html).


### What I study

The primary focus of my thesis work is studying how the event horizons of two black
holes join together to form a single black hole.
Here's a page that explains more about my studies
on [event horizons]({{site.url}}/research/event-horizons.html).
In fact, the banner art at the top of this page is
actual output from my work studying event horizons!

I also spent some time studying what black holes, and
even merging black holes really look like!
Here's a page that explains [gravitational lensing]({{site.url}}/research/lensing.html).
The banner art on the home page and the about me page show off some output
of our gravitational lensing work.
