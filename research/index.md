I study numerical relativity under
[Saul Teukolsky](http://astro.cornell.edu/members/saul-a-teukolsky.html) at
Cornell University.

When I was in grade school and was first told about black holes, the first
questions I asked were:

1. What does a black hole really look like?
2. What happens when you get sucked into a black hole?
3. What would happen when one black hole tries to eat another black hole?
