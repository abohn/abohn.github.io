### Getting started

When I was in grade school and first learned that mysterious objects called
black holes existed, a few
questions that popped into my head were:

1. What does a black hole really look like?
2. What happens when you get sucked into a black hole?
3. What would happen when one black hole tries to eat another black hole?

At the time, I didn't know how to find the answers to these questions,
and they unfortunately laid dormant in the back of my mind for another decade
or so.

Fast forward to my first summer of graduate school at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) in 2011, when the new students
were supposed to try and find a research group to start a fruitful career,
or something like that.
My friend told me he wanted to study black holes and neutron stars
with
[Saul Teukolsky](http://astro.cornell.edu/members/saul-a-teukolsky.html).
In an instant all of my questions about black holes came flooding back to the
forefront of my mind, and I was fortunate enough to start to pursue these
questions with Saul straight away!.

### What my group studies

Einstein's theory of
[General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)
makes a whole host of predictions that can be experimentally verified.
One important example is that
[light is bent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#Light_deflection_and_gravitational_time_delay)
in a particular way by gravity,
so light rays passing by the sun are slightly bent around the sun.

Another example is [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System).
GPS operates by satellites sending a message that says what time the message was
sent as well as which satellite sent the message.
A GPS device receives these messages, computes how far away each satellite is, then
[triangulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation) its location.
For a GPS device to be accurate to about 15 meters, the GPS satellites must be
accurate to about 50 nanoseconds (50 nanoseconds = 15 meters / speed of light).
An interesting consequence of general relativity is that time ticks more slowly
when in a stronger field of gravity than otherwise.
GPS satellites orbit 12,600 miles above the surface of the Earth and experience a
four times weaker field of gravity than on the surface, so the satellite clock
is about 45 microseconds faster per day than a clock on Earth.
Without General Relativity (and Special Relativity for similar reasons),
GPS would have significant issues.

As technology and ingenuity advances, we have been able to test more and
more of the theory with increasing accuracy, and the theory has passed with flying
colors.

### What I study

The primary focus of my thesis work is studying how the event horizons of two black
holes join together to form a single black hole.
